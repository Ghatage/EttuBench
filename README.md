### Introduction
This repository is used to store all the code and data we use to produce experimental results in paper "Towards Effective Log Clustering"

Data folder contains all the data we use for experiments.

### Reproducing experimental results
## Reproduce figure 2
In order to reproduce distribution of silhouette coefficients when using Aligon similarity without regularization and when regularization is applied as shown in Figure 2 of the paper, users can open the file *script_figure_2.R*. Running this script file will produce the silhouette plots in folder *figure*.

## Reproduce figure 3
In order to reproduce the plots for comparison between three similarity metrics (Aligon, Aouiche, Makiyama) on three datasets (IIT Bombay, UB Exam and PocketData-Google+ datasets) with and without regularization as shown in Figure 3 of the paper, users can open the file *script_figure_3.R*. Running this script file will produce the corresponding figures in folder *figure*.

## Reproduce figure 4
In order to reproduce the plots for comparing the effect of different modules in regularization as shown in Figure 4 of the paper, users can open the file *script_figure_4.R*. Running this script file will produce the corresponding figures in folder *figure*.
